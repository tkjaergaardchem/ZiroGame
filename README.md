# ZiroGame
An adventure game

Hi all.

I am a certified software tester, which is getting tired of destroying and would much rather create. So i have been learning some coding; java and Python and will try to create a Python project to practise.

My plan is to do the following:
1. Learn Pyunit 
2. Learn more about algoritm and datastructure
3. Next level of python programming.
4. Djanogo
5. SQL
6. HTML5 and CSS3
7. Javascript
8. Git (github)
9. finish my practise "game" and hopefully get a developer job.
